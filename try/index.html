                            <p>As I getting closer the end of this semester, I can say that everything went well. I’ve been concentrating lately on the assignments and portfolios that I have to complete. In my classes, I’ve been learning a lot of fresh and fascinating information. Although some topics have been difficult for me to understand, it has been a great opportunity for me to develop. Some of the things I’ve learned, especially in web and fundamentals, have surprised me. </p>

                            <p>Artificial intelligence, also known as AI, is the creation of computer systems that are capable of carrying out tasks that would typically require human intelligence, such as comprehending natural language, identifying sounds and images, and making judgments based on data. Narrow AI and general AI are the two main subfields of AI. Narrow AI is created to carry out particular tasks, like speech or image recognition. On the other hand, general AI seeks to develop a system that is capable of carrying out any intellectual task that a human can.</p>

                            <p>The guest lecturer’s delivery of this lecture set it apart from other lectures in a big way. It was a completely new experience for me to be in a class where we learned about and were aware of online fraud. The value of cyber security cannot be overstated as the world becomes more dependent on the internet and digital technology. </p>
